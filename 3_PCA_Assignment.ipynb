    "Ans.\n",
    "The spectral theorem is significant in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach because it provides a mathematical\n",

    "the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, and the eigenvalues represent the scaling factors along those eigenvectors.\n",

    "eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which simplifies various mathematical operations and enables a deeper understanding of the \n",

    "The characteristic polynomial is det(A−λI)=0, which yields λ1=3 and λ2=6.\n",
    "For λ1=3, solving (A−3I)v=0 gives v1 =[1 1]\n",
    "For λ2=6, solving (A−6I)v=0 gives v2 =[−1 2]\n",

    "Now, the matrix Q composed of these eigenvectors is:\n",
